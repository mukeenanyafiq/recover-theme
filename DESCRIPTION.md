A theme that literally makes **the entire track cover fills up the entire screen on Full-screen mode** _(by height)_

# Features
- Cool-looking track cover which gets transparent on the very edge
- Track info moved to the top left
- Video mode will keep its appearances that way, but the video (track) info would still be put on top of the frame

Some downsides that this theme can't control:
- Most track cover image would look blurry when resized to fill up the entire screen

# reCover (Theme for Better Lyrics)

> inspired by the Better Lyrics demo video

A theme that literally makes the **entire track cover fills up the entire screen on Full-screen mode** _(by height)_

No worries, all things considered
- Video mode will keep its appearances that way, but the title and the creator info would be put on top of the frame

There are some downsides though, but I'd probably have to make a PR for it to write these off the list
- Most track cover image would look blurry when resized to fill up the entire screen
